lead: 'cantautor.es is a joint personal project with Daniela Grau. We want to give Spanish singer-songwriters more attention, having created a place where you can listen to excerpts of selected songs. Being based on a Spotify playlist, we have a lot of plans for this project: In the long run, we want to make it independent of large providers and support the artists themselves instead.'
